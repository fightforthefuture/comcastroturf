    <h3>What we know so far</h3>
    <p>We know that nearly half a million identical anti- net neutrality comments have been submitted, many in <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/a-bot-is-flooding-the-fccs-website-with-fake-anti-net-neutrality-comments/">alphabetical order</a>. We also know the comment text is associated with a non-public petition by a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/10/15610744/anti-net-neutrality-fake-comments-identities">relatively unknown group</a>. And it seems that at least several people <a href="http://kdvr.com/2017/05/14/7000-coloradans-names-addresses-used-to-post-fake-comments-about-government-decision/">did not knowingly sign</a> the petition</a>.</p>

    <h3>What we need</h3>
    <p>There is still a remote chance that some of the signatures are legitimate, or that individuals were somehow tricked into signing a comment&mdash;perhaps thinking it was in favor of net neutrality. We need to learn the extent to which these comments are fake, so we need as many as possible examples of people who are 100% sure they never signed. Once we have that, we can work with State AGs to track down the group committing this fraud, and figure out who funds them.</p>
